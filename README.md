# odin-recursion

Built two Javascript functions that return the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) up to the number passed to the function. One using iteration and the other using recursion.

Also built a javascript algorithm with recursion for [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) that takes an array of numbers and sorts the numbers from low to high.
